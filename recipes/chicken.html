    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Sometimes in cooking the simplest dishes are the hardest to get right, 
        and grilled chicken is a perfect example. Because boneless chicken 
        breasts are so lean, they often turn out dry, rubbery, and bland. 
        Contrary to popular belief, marinating alone will not prevent grilled 
        chicken from drying out; in fact, it’s often the marinade that causes 
        the problem!
    </p>

    <p>
        My technique and marinade ensure tender, juicy, and flavorful grilled 
        chicken every time. You can serve the fillets on their own as a healthy 
        main course (kids love them), topped with cheese on a toasted bun, or, 
        as I often do, sliced over a Caesar salad. Bonus: the recipe is quick 
        and easy. You do all of the prep ahead of time and you won’t even dirty 
        a single bowl.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <div class="container">
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1¾ lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons lemon zest, from one lemon</li>
        </ul>
    
    </div>
    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol>

                <strong>
                    Pound the Chicken:
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Place the chicken breasts in a 1-gallon freezer bag and pound 
                to an even ½-inch thickness. This both tenderizes the meat and 
                ensures even cooking. Left in their natural shape, the thin side 
                of the fillet dries out while the thicker side finishes cooking. 
                If you don’t have a meat mallet, a rolling pin or a saucepan 
                will both work well.

                    Make the Marinade:
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Lemon is a key ingredient in this marinade, but I only use the 
                zest. Contrary to conventional wisdom, acidic ingredients 
                (such as vinegar or lemon juice) do not tenderize lean boneless 
                chicken breasts. Just the opposite: they “cook” the exterior of 
                the meat and give it a leathery texture. The zest gives the 
                chicken ample lemon flavor without affecting the chicken’s 
                succulent texture.
            </p>

            <p>
                The best tool for zesting citrus is a fine or microplane grater. 
                Simply rub the lemon in one direction against the blades, 
                turning the lemon as you go. Be sure to remove only the yellow 
                part; the white pith underneath is bitter.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you’ve zested the lemon, mix all of the marinade ingredients 
                except for the chicken together in a 1-gallon zip-lock bag 
                (go ahead and use the same one you used for pounding if it 
                is still in good shape).
            </p>

            <p>
                Add the chicken breasts to the bag and massage the marinade into 
                the meat until evenly coated.
            </p>

                <strong>
                    Marinate:
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Seal the bag and place in a bowl in the refrigerator (the bowl 
                protects against leakage); let the chicken marinate for at least 4 
                hours or overnight.
            </p>

        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Grill
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                When you’re ready to eat, preheat your grill to high heat and 
                oil the grates (clean, oiled grates will give you the best grill 
                marks). Be sure your grill is very hot before cooking the 
                chicken; you want nice grill marks and char in the short amount 
                of time it takes to cook these. When pounded thin, chicken 
                breasts only need 2 to 3 minutes per side…no more! If you try 
                to flip the chicken and it feels stuck, try giving it 30 seconds. 
                It’ll release naturally when it’s ready.
            </p>

            <p>
                You’ll notice that the recipe calls for the grill to be covered 
                while the chicken is cooking. This creates convection heat which 
                helps give the chicken a nicely charred exterior and a tender, 
                moist interior.
            </p>

            <p>
                After removing the chicken from the grill, let it rest for 3 to 
                4 minutes before cutting into it. This will help keep the juices 
                in and retain the meat’s moisture. (The timing is perfect as 
                it’s just enough to get it onto plates, add sides, and put on 
                the table).
            </p>

            <p>
                While this chicken is best right off the grill, it’s also the 
                kind of thing you can make a double batch of and freeze for 
                future use in salads, pastas, and sandwiches.
            </p>
