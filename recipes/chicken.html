    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Sometimes in cooking the simplest dishes are the hardest to get right, 
        and grilled chicken is a perfect example. Because boneless chicken 
        breasts are so lean, they often turn out dry, rubbery, and bland. 
        Contrary to popular belief, marinating alone will not prevent grilled 
        chicken from drying out; in fact, it’s often the marinade that causes 
        the problem!
    </p>

    <p>
        My technique and marinade ensure tender, juicy, and flavorful grilled 
        chicken every time. You can serve the fillets on their own as a healthy 
        main course (kids love them), topped with cheese on a toasted bun, or, 
        as I often do, sliced over a Caesar salad. Bonus: the recipe is quick 
        and easy. You do all of the prep ahead of time and you won’t even dirty 
        a single bowl.
